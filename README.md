# Token Complexity

**Token Complexity** computes a fine-grained measure of reasoning problem difficulty for 
large language models (LLMs),
given a dataset of Chain-of-Thought prompts with varying response lengths. Token complexity
is the minimum number of Chain-of-Thought output tokens required to solve a reasoning task, and we show in this work that this measure is universal across qualitatively different chains-of-thought.

We calculate token complexities for MMLU-Pro Math, GSM8K, and MATH-500. The data is available at

## Features

Token complexity is a useful notion for researchers to study the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
- **Fine-grained measure of difficulty**: Token complexity offers a fine-grained notion of problem difficulty that is tailored to the LLM, rather than coarse classifications of 'easy' or 'hard'.
- **Assessing adaptive response length**: By looking at correlations of response length with token complexity, we can assess whether the LLM chooses the response length *adaptively*, using shorter responses for easier questions.
- **Improving the trade-off between response length and accuracy**: By predicting token complexity,
one can tailor response length precisely to the problem, reducing inference costs.
